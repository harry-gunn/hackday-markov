I used a dataset of 55,000 song lyrics from kaggle, with the following column metadata:

    artist: String
    song:   String
    link:   String
    text:   String

For different datasets the initial csv read and filter may have to be changed.

Export csv location as LyricsCsvPath.

Change the artist as you see fit and run.


The mostsongs was used to help me determine.... Which artists had the most songs in this dataset.
